# Setting up a frontend module

## Prerequisites

To work on the O3 frontend, you will need to have the following tools and technologies set up:

- **Git** - We use git for version control.
- **Node.js** - We use Node for compiling and bundling frontend code. We don’t use Node for running the backend or server. We recommend using the active `LTS` version and using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple versions of Node.
- **Yarn** - We primarily use Yarn `v3` as our package manager.

## Code organization

Code in O3 is organized into several domain-specific monorepos:

- [openmrs-esm-core](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core) - contains the core packages for the 3.x frontend. The packages handle ‘cross-cutting’ concerns such as error handling, extensions, react utils, the style guide, the core framework, and more.
- [openmrs-esm-patient-chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) - contains the patient dashboard which renders several widgets including allergies, conditions, medications, vitals and biometrics.
- [openmrs-esm-patient-management](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management) - handles concerns related to managing patients. Includes frontend modules that handle searching for a patient, patient registration, managing patient lists, appointment scheduling and service queues.
- [openmrs-esm-home](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-home) - contains the home page, which sets up the home navigation that contains links to dashboards with the appointments, patient lists, and service queues frontend modules.

## Installation

Most times, you'll be working within one monorepo. Generally speaking, to set up one of these monorepos locally, you'd need to:

- Clone the repo of interest.
- `cd` into the root directory of the repo on your local copy and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Editor setup

We typically use Visual Studio code when developing on O3. We recommend setting up the following extensions to enhance your development workflow:

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - automatic code formatting. All our monorepos contain a Prettier configuration. Setting up this extension enables Prettier to automatically format your code each time you make a commit.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - static code analysis tool. ESLint finds and fixes problems in your code and will help flag lint issues as you write your code.
