# Developing frontend modules

After [setting up](/docs/frontend-modules/setup) a frontend module locally, you'll want to start making changes to it. This guide will walk you through the steps you need to follow when doing local development on a frontend module. We'll cover how to install dependencies, run frontend modules locally, write tests, push your changes to GitHub, maintain dependencies and troubleshoot common issues.

## Installing dependencies

In most cases, we use the latest version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) as our package manager. To install dependencies, you'll typically `cd` into your local copy of the frontend module you want to work on and run `yarn` (which is short for `yarn install`). For example, if you want to work on the [Patient Chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) frontend module, you'd run:

```sh
cd openmrs-esm-patient-chart
yarn
```

## Running frontend modules locally

### Non-monorepos

Some of our projects are not monorepos. For example, the [Form Builder](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-form-builder) is a standalone project. To run the Form Builder locally, you'd `cd` into the project directory and run `yarn start`. For example:

```sh
cd openmrs-esm-form-builder
yarn start
```

You shouldn't need to scope commands by their target packages in non-monorepos.

### Monorepos

Most of our frontend modules are part of monorepos. For example, the [Patient Chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) monorepo consists of several frontend modules that handle Patient-related concerns. You'll typically want to run a specific frontend module within a monorepo. To do that, run `yarn start --sources` and pass in the relative path to your target frontend module. For example, to run just the [Vitals](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/tree/main/packages/esm-patient-vitals-app) frontend module, you'd run:

```sh
yarn start --sources packages/esm-patient-vitals-app
```

Where the argument following `--sources` is the relative path to the frontend module you want to run.

It is possible to run multiple frontend module simultaneously. For example, if you're making changes to the [Order Basket](https://zeroheight.com/23a080e38/p/71ad91-order-basket), you'll likely want to test those changes against the Medications and Orders frontend modules. To do that, you'd run:

```sh
yarn start --sources packages/esm-patient-medications packages/esm-patient-orders-app
```

This should fire up a Webpack dev server running local copies of the Medications and Orders frontend modules. Any local changes should propagate to the dev server in your browser.

By default, the dev server will run on port 8080. If you wish to run the server on a different port, you can pass a port number as the argument to the `--port` flag. For example, to run a dev server for the Vitals frontend module on port 7000, you'd run:

```sh
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-patient-vitals-app' --port=7000
```

<Callout type="info">
  **`openmrs` tooling deep dive**

`yarn start` is a shorthand for running the [openmrs CLI](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core/tree/main/packages/tooling/openmrs). More specifically, it's aliased to run `openmrs develop`, which creates a produ ction build of the app shell and runs it against a given OpenMRS backend. It spins up a Webpack dev server on port 8080 and proxies requests to the default backend, which is hosted at https://dev3.openmrs.org. This dev server will by default run local copies of the frontend modules you specify and override their import map entries. All the other frontend modules run on that dev server should be the latest versions from the community dev3 server. With `openmrs develop`, you can also:

- Specify an alternative backend server (other than the community dev3 server) and proxy requests to it. For example, to run the Vitals app and proxy requests to the O3 QA dev environment's backend, you can run:

  ```sh
  yarn start --sources packages/esm-patient-vitals-app --backend=https://test3.openmrs.org
  ```

- Specifying an alternative target server path (defaults to `/openmrs/spa`).
- Specifying an alternative API URL (defaults to `openmrs`).
- Specifying a custom import map.

To learn more about the `develop` command, read through its [implementation](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core/blob/main/packages/tooling/openmrs/src/commands/develop.ts).

</Callout>

## Using import map overrides

O3 determines where to load the code for frontend modules from based on the [import map](/docs/core-concepts#import-map) provided to the app shell. The import map is a JSON object that maps module specifiers to URLs. You can find the import map for your O3 distro by navigating to `/openmrs/spa/importmap.json` in your browser. The [Devtools](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core/tree/main/packages/apps/esm-devtools-app) frotend modules provides an interface for overriding entries in your import map. You can leverage this when doing local development to load copies of your frontend modules from your local dev server. For example, if you fire up a [local development server running the app shell](docs/frontend-modules/development#running-the-app-shell-locally), it's possible to override import map entries for multiple frotend modules from multiple projects at the same time. This is useful when you're working on a feature that spans multiple frontend modules.

<Callout type="warning">
  Import map overrides don't work on the dev3 server because of security restrictions. We'll work on loosening these
  restrictions in the future. For now, you can only use import map overrides on a local dev server.
</Callout>

### Example: Running the Implementer tools and Primary navigation frontend modules against the app shell

<Steps>

### Run the app shell

```sh
cd @openmrs/esm-core
yarn run:shell
```

This should fire up a dev server on port 8080 (assuming you have no other dev server running).

### Run the implementer tools app

In a different terminal window, run:

```sh
cd openmrs/esm-core
yarn start --sources packages/apps/esm-implementer-tools-app --port=7000
```

This should fire up a dev server on port 8081 (the next available port). To see the actual bundled JavaScript code for the app, navigate to http://localhost:8081/openmrs-esm-implementer-tools-app.js in your browser. This URL is the entry point for the app shell to load the implementer tools app. It's important that the URL points to the correct location of the bundled JavaScript code. Often, you might want to specify a different port number to ensure that the URL points to the correct location than the default port or whatever port the tooling assigns.

<Callout type="info">
**Port numbers**

By default, the Webpack dev server runs on port 8080. If you're running multiple dev servers, the next available port is assigned to the next dev server. For example, if you're running a dev server on port 8080 and you start another dev server, it will run on port 8081. If you start another dev server, it will run on port 8082, and so on. This is also important to not when setting up import map overrides. If you're running a frontend module using `yarn start` on port 8080, the URL to the bundled JavaScript code will be http://localhost:8081/openmrs-esm-form-builder-app.js. The name of this URL corresponds to the name used in the [browser](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-form-builder/blob/main/package.json#L6) entry in the `package.json` file of the frontend module you're running. If you're running a frontend module on a different port, you'll need to adjust the URL accordingly.

Note that if you're running multiple frontend modules simultaneously using `yarn start`, the app shell will run on port 8080 and the frontend modules will run on the next available ports. That is, the packages will run on port 8081, 8082, and so on, if available. However, if you're running each frontend module individually, you'll likely have to configure the port number manually as the app shell will default to trying to load the frontend module from the next available port after 8080.

</Callout>

### Run the primary navigation app

In a different terminal window, run:

```sh
cd openmrs/esm-core
yarn start --sources packages/apps/esm-primary-navigation-app --port=9000
```

### Consolidate everything

On the dev server running the app shell, login and navigate to the home page. We want to make sure that import map overrides are enabled. Type this command in the browser devtools console and press enter:

```sh
localStorage.setItem('openmrs:devtools', 'true')
```

Reload the page. You should see a new icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. Click on it to launch the import map overrides panel. You can now override import map entries for the frontend modules in your distribution with locally running copies. Add an import map override for the Implementer tools app by searching for the app in the `Search modules` input field. You should see the app in the search results. Type the URL to the bundled JavaScript code for the app in the `URL` input field.

For the Implementer tools app on port 7000, the URL ideally would be http://localhost:7001/openmrs-esm-implementer-tools-app.js. To check the URL more accurately you can navigate to the network tab of where the ESM is running and find out there.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating looking for the openmrs-esm-patient-orders-app in chrome.

<br />
![chrome import map example](/chrome-import-map-example.png)
<br />

After findng out the correct url click the `Apply` button to add the override.
Next, do the same for the Primary navigation app. The URL for the Primary
navigation app on port 9000 would ideally be
http://localhost:9001/openmrs-esm-primary-navigation-app.js. Click the `Apply`
button to add the override. The changes should take effect immediately. If you
reload the page, you should see the icon turn red to signify that there are
import map overrides in place.

You should now see your changes to the Implementer tools and Primary navigation apps propagate to the app shell. You can now test out your changes in the context of the app shell.

</Steps>

## Running `esm-patient-common-lib` locally

The `esm-patient-common-lib` is a library of common components and utilities used primarily by the patient chart in O3. You might to make changes to the library and test those changes against a local dev server. To achieve that, you can do the following:

- Launch the `package.json` file for the frontend module you want to work on. Look for the `esm-patient-common-lib` dependency in the `peerDependencies` section. Remove that entry and run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run your local dev server using `yarn start`. For example, for the labs app, run:

  ```sh
  yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-patient-labs-app'
  ```

- Try making a change to a library, e.g. adding a `console.log` to a file such as `DashboardExtension.tsx`. Your dev server should reload and you should see your `console.log` printed in the browser console once you navigate to the patient chart.
- Once you're done making changes, you can revert the changes you made to the `package.json` file and run `yarn` to install dependencies again.

## Running the app shell locally

Most of the time, this should be all a developer needs to do to get a local dev server running. One notable departure, however, is running the `app shell`. You’ll need to run the shell directly if you want to:

- Make changes to the `styleguide` frontend module and test them out locally.
- Test out changes to the following applications:

  - `devtools` - used for setting up import map overrides.
  - `implementer tools` - used for configuring extensions and UI components on the fly.
  - `login` - the reference application login page.
  - `offline tools` - the offline tools dashboard.
  - `primary navigation` - the navigation menu.

To run the app shell, you’ll need to `cd` into the `esm-core` monorepo and run:

```sh
yarn run:shell
```

This command will fire up a dev server at `http://localhost:8080/openmrs/spa`. You can then navigate to the app shell at `http://localhost:8080/openmrs/spa/shell`. From there, you can navigate to the applications you want to test out.

Because these applications reside in the `apps` directory of the `esm-core` monorepo, running them within the context of the app shell makes it a lot easier to test out changes. Something to note when using this approach, however, is that for your changes to propagate to your local server, you might need to rebuild your frontend module. To do this, run:

```sh
yarn turbo build
```

This command should run the `build` script in all of the constituent frontend modules whose code you’ve changed. Once the build is complete, you should see your changes reflected in the dev server in your browser.

## How do I know where to make changes?

There is no simple correlation between frontend modules and pages and content. The first step to figuring out where to make changes is to identify the frontend module you want to work on. For example, if you want to make changes to the patient chart, you’d work on the `patient-chart` frontend module. If you want to make changes to the patient search, you’d work on the `patient-search` frontend module. If you want to make changes to the login page, you’d work on the `login` frontend module. And so on. There are a few ways to figure out which frontend module you need to work on:

- You can inspect an element in the browser and look at its class name. You can then search through your IDE for that class name. This should point you to the specific bit of code in the frontend module you need to work on.
- You could search for specific strings in the codebase. For example, if you see the string `Vitals history` in the UI, you could search for that string in your IDE. This should point you to the frontend module that renders that string (the vitals frontend module, in this case).
- You could also use the UI editor in the implementer tools to see which extensions and extension slots get rendered in the UI. You can then search for those extensions and extension slots in your IDE and make changes to them. This is a bit more involved, but it’s a good way to get a sense of the structure of the UI and frontend modules it contains.
- Go through the list of [key repositories](/docs/key-repositories) and their descriptions. There aren’t very many and they're typically domain-specific, so it’s likely you can narrow down what you’re trying to work on just by looking at the list.

There are no hard and fast rules for figuring out where to make changes. The best approach is to try out different things and see what works for you. The more you work on the codebase, the more familiar you’ll become with it and the easier it’ll be to figure out where to make changes. If you have done all of the things above and still haven’t found the code you’re looking for, feel free to ask in the [#openmrs-helpme channel](https://openmrs.slack.com/archives/C02UNMKFH8V) on Slack.

## How can I develop against a restricted environment?

In general, you can develop against another environment using the `--backend` flag. If the other environment is guarded, e.g., by an IP or network restriction then this is something you need to take care of on your local machine. In case the guarded environment is restricted via some SSO mechanism using a cookie you could use the `--add-cookie` flag to achieve this. As an example, look at the access for a development server from the ICRC:

```sh
npx openmrs start --backend "https://emr-v2.test.icrc.org/" --add-cookie "MRHSession=1234..."
```

The cookie must be obtained by you and strongly depends on the backend used.

## Should I write tests?

Yes, absolutely! We have a test suite for the frontend modules in the monorepo. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. We also use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing React components. We have a [testing guide](/docs/frontend-modules/testing) that you can refer to for more information on how to write tests. We're adding support for [Playwright e2e tests](https://playwright.dev/) as well across our repositories. Consider adding e2e tests for your changes as well. Going through the testing guide as well as the tests in the codebase should give you a good sense of how to write tests.

## Pushing your changes to GitHub

Once you’re done working on a feature or fix, you’ll want to push your changes to GitHub and file a PR. To do this, package your changes in a commit. We have guidelines for writing commit messages in our [contributing guide](https://o3-dev.docs.openmrs.org/#/getting_started/contributing).

Creating a commit should trigger some pre-commit hooks. Typically, part of the work these hooks do involves running `yarn run extract-translations`. This task fires up `turborepo` and runs the `extract-translations` task in each package in the monorepo. This task extracts translation keys and strings and updates the default locale’s translations file, `en.json` in the `translations` directory of your frontend module. This is useful for internationalization. After the pre-commit hooks run, you then want to push your changes to GitHub. Doing so will trigger a `pre-push` hook that will typically run the following tasks in parallel using `turborepo`:

- `typescript` - checks your application’s types.
- `lint` - runs a lint check using Prettier.
- `test` - runs tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

If any of these tasks fail, the push should fail. The terminal should display the error message(s) that caused the push to fail. You’ll need to fix the error(s) and push again. Once the push succeeds, you can go to the GitHub repo related to your package and file a pull request.

## Maintaining dependencies

Maintaining up-to-date dependencies is important to leverage the latest features, performance improvements and security patches. Yarn 3 provides a handy interactive tool to help you keep your dependencies up to date. To use it, run the following command:

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

This command lists the dependencies of your project that are eligible for updates. You can navigate the list using your keyboard's arrow keys. In general, you want to avoid making major version updates because they can introduce breaking changes. You also want to keep OpenMRS-related dependencies (such as `openmrs` and `@openmrs/esm-framework`) pinned to `next`. Everything else should generally be OK to update to the latest version. Once you've selected the dependencies you want to update, you can press `Enter` to update them. Make sure to test your changes to ensure that nothing has broken. Ensure the app runs OK, tests pass and the app can get built correctly. If everything looks good, you can commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting a bunch of errors related to missing dependencies

If you're working off of a fork, your fork might miss the latest changes from `main`. To fix this, you can run the following command to update your fork:

```sh
git pull upstream main --rebase
```

### I'm getting an `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached` error

If you’re running Linux, you may see the following error the first time you run a dev server: `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`. If that happens, you need to increase the system limit for the number of file watchers. See this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55763478/1464495).

### I see errors about missing APIs when I run the app

If your dev server is throwing errors about missing APIs or functions, it's likely because you're running outdated versions of the framework or core tooling. This means that new functionality was likely added to [Core](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) that your local dev server doesn't have. New pre-release versions of the [openmrs](https://npmjs.com/package/openmrs) CLI and [@openmrs/esm-framework](https://npmjs.com/package/@openmrs/esm-framework) get published each time a pull request is merged in Core. To ensure you have the latest versions of these packages, run:

```sh
yarn up openmrs@next @openmrs/esm-framework@next
```

This command might change the versions of the packages specified in your manifest file (`package.json`). If it does, you'll need to revert the versions back to `next` before you commit your changes. You might need to run `yarn` to install the new versions of the packages after effecting the changes. Once you've done that, you should be able to run the dev server without any issues. Be sure to only commit the updated `yarn.lock` file. You'll run this command frequently enough when working on O3 that it might make sense to add an alias for it in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file. Something similar to the following:

```sh
alias bump-core-tooling="yarn up openmrs@next @openmrs/esm-framework@next && git checkout package.json && yarn"
```

This command will update the versions of the packages specified in your manifest file (`package.json`) to the latest versions and revert the versions back to `next` after the command runs. It will then install the new versions of the packages. Be sure to review the changes to the `package.json` file and revert the versions back to `next` before committing your changes.

### I'm getting a `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error when running `yarn run build`

If you're running or building the `form-entry` package (an Angular wrapper around the AMPATH Form Engine) using Node v18, you may see the following error:

```sh
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
    at new Hash (node:internal/crypto/hash:71:19)
    at Object.createHash (node:crypto:133:10)

  library: 'digital envelope routines',
  reason: 'unsupported',
  code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'
}
```

To get around this, run:

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

### I'm getting errors after upgrading `@carbon/react`

You might see the following errors in your terminal when running a local dev server after upgrading `@carbon/react`:

```sh
ERROR in src/components/search-history/search-history.component.tsx:8:3
TS2305: Module '"@carbon/react"' has no exported member 'ModalHeader'.

ERROR in src/components/search-history/search-history.component.tsx:9:3
TS2305: Module '"@carbon/react"' has no exported member 'Pagination'.
```

To fix these, you need to update Carbon's ambient type declarations. To do so, add the following entries to your `declarations.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare module "@carbon/react";
declare type SideNavProps = {};
```

### I'm getting merge conflicts in my `yarn.lock` file

To resolve merge conflicts in your `yarn.lock` file, run the following command:

```sh
git checkout HEAD yarn.lock && yarn
```

### The `verify` job is failing on GitHub Actions for my PR

You likely have a lint or typescript error in your code. ESLint is setup to fail when it flags warnings. Run `yarn turbo lint` locally to the specific lint error in your IDE. For TypeScript errors, you should see the error in the CI log. If not, run `yarn turbo typescript` locally.

### I'm getting `502` errors from attempting to fetch the session when running a local dev server

If you're running a local dev server and you're getting `502` errors from attempting to fetch the session, that's likely because the dev3 server (which your local dev server proxies to) is down. Check that you can log in to [dev3](https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa) first.
If you cannot log in, then you'll need to wait for the server to come back up.

### I'm using `@openmrs/esm-patient-common-lib` and getting "No workspace named '...' has been registered"

If you're getting this error, you most likely need to add `@openmrs/esm-patient-common-lib` to the `peerDependencies` list in your `package.json`. Also, make sure that you have `@openmrs/esm-patient-common-lib`: `next` listed under your `devDependencies`.

### I'm getting an `Oops! An unhandled promise rejection occurred` error when loading my dev server

If you see an `Unhandled promise rejection` error when running a dev server or a production instance of O3, it likely means that you have a module that is not getting loaded correctly. The devtools console in your browser will likely contain an error message about the module that is not getting loaded. Typically, you'll want to start by checking that you don't have any stale overrides set up in the import map overrides panel. To fix the error, you will likely need to open the implementer tools panel and click the `Reset all overrides` button. Once you've done that, reload the page. The error should go away. Alternatively, you could also look through your browser's local storage and delete any overrides that you find there. Remember to reload the page after doing so.

### I'm running into memory issues when building Core

When testing changes to Core by running `yarn run:shell` from the `esm-core` directory, you'll typically want to run `yarn turbo build` to ensure that you are running the latest changes. You might run into errors like the following when running the Webpack build:

```sh
error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

To do so, run the following command:

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
```

This command increases the memory limit for the Node.js process to 8GB. Note that increasing the memory limit can impact system performance. You should only increase the memory limit when necessary.

Alternatively, you could also run

```sh
git clean -fdx
```

This command removes untracked files and directories from your working directory and resets the git index. This can help resolve issues with the build process by cleaning up build artifacts, `node_modules` directories, and other temporary files that can sometimes cause issues with the build process. It might be a good idea to do this before running `yarn turbo build` to ensure that you're starting with a clean slate. Note that this command will irreversibly delete files in your working directory. Make sure you don't have any important files in your working directory that you don't want to lose.
