# Setting up a frontend module

## Prerequisites

To work on the O3 frontend, you will need to have the following tools and technologies set up:

- `git` - we use git for version control.
- `node` - we use Node for compiling and bundling frontend code. We don’t use Node for running the backend or server. We recommend using the active LTS version and using nvm to manage multiple versions of Node.
- `yarn` - the package manager we use. We primarily use Yarn v3.

## Code organization

Code in O3 is organized into several domain-specific monorepos:

- [openmrs-esm-core](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core) - contains the core packages for the 3.x frontend. The packages handle ‘cross-cutting’ concerns such as error handling, extensions, react utils, the style guide, the core framework, and more.
- [openmrs-esm-patient-chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) - contains the patient dashboard which renders several widgets including allergies, conditions, medications, vitals and biometrics.
- [openmrs-esm-patient-management](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management) - handles concerns related to managing patients. Includes frontend modules that handle searching for a patient, patient registration, managing patient lists, appointment scheduling and service queues.
- [openmrs-esm-home](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-home) - contains the home page, which sets up the home navigation that contains links to dashboards with the appointments, patient lists, and service queues frontend modules.

Most times, you'll be working within one monorepo. Generally speaking, to set up one of these monorepos locally, you'd need to:

- Clone the repo of interest.
- `cd` into the root directory of the repo on your machine and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Editor setup

We typically use Visual Studio code when developing on O3. We recommend setting up the following extensions to enhance your development workflow:

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - automatic code formatting. All our monorepos contain a Prettier configuration. Setting up this extension enables Prettier to automatically format your code each time you make a commit.
- [ESLint](https://www.notion.so/Steve-s-items-bought-from-the-US-99d52797d00a4968a3be2079769e1a93) - static code analysis tool. ESLint finds and fixes problems in your code and will help flag lint issues as you write your code.
