# Testing

We use a combination of unit testing, integration testing, and e2e testing to ensure the reliability and maintainability of O3. We use the following tools:

- [Jest](https://vitest.dev) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react) for unit and integration testing.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for e2e testing.

The following are some general guidelines for testing:

### Unit and integration testing

- Avoid these [common testing pitfalls](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library):

  - Don't use the wrong assertion. Install and use [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) to extend Jest's `expect` with assertions for testing React components.
  - Don't use the wrong query. Use [this resource](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-which-query) to choose the right query for the element you want to test.
  - Don't use `query*` variants for _anything_ except checking if an element exists. Only use `query*` variants for asserting that an element does not exist.
  - Don't use `waitFor` to wait for elements that can be queried with `screen.find*`.

  ```tsx
  // ❌
  const submitButton = await waitFor(() =>
    screen.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i })
  );

  // ✅
  const submitButton = await screen.findByRole("button", { name: /submit/i });
  ```

  - Don't pass an empty callback to `waitFor`.

  ```tsx
  // ❌
  await waitFor(() => {});
  expect(window.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith("foo");
  expect(window.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

  // ✅
  await waitFor(() => expect(window.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith("foo"));
  expect(window.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  ```

  - Don't add `aria-*`, `role`, and other accessibility attributes to elements unless the application actually uses them.
  - Use the Testing Library's ESLint plugins: [eslint-plugin-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library) and [eslint-plugin-jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-jest-dom).
  - Don't use the `cleanup` function. RTL takes care of cleaning up after each test.
  - Use `screen` to query and debug elements. This is the recommended way to find elements in your tests as it ensures you're working with the current document and provides better error messages.

  ```tsx
  // ❌
  const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
  const element = getByText(/hello/i);

  // ✅
  render(<MyComponent />);
  const element = screen.getByText(/hello/i);
  ```

  - Don't unnecessarily wrap things in `act`. Follow [this guide](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-not-wrapped-in-act-warning) instead to fix `Not wrapped in act(...)` warnings.
  - Don't use `render` or `renderHook` to wrap components in tests.

- [Avoid the test user](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).
- Avoid testing implementation details. Instead, test the component's public API. This makes it easier to refactor the component without having to rewrite the tests.
- When stubbing out functionality from `@openmrs/esm-framework`, follow the mocking patterns described [here](/docs/frontend-modules/unit-and-integration-testing#mocking-patterns).
- Write fewer, more comprehensive tests that cover complete scenarios, rather than many small isolated tests. Read this [blog post by Testing Library author, Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-fewer-longer-tests) for more information.
  - Group related test scenarios together.
  - Build up complex scenarios progressively.
  - Use test hooks (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`) to reduce duplication.
- Don't clear mocks in `beforeEach` hooks. Most mocks should be cleared automatically by the testing framework if you have this set in your root-level jest config:

  ```ts
  // jest.config.js
  clearMocks: true,
  ```

- Don't mock components. Instead, render them with the real implementation. This makes it easier to catch regressions when refactoring components.

  ```tsx
  // ❌
  jest.mock("./my-component", () => ({
    __esModule: true,
    default: () => <div>My Component</div>,
  }));
  ```

  ```tsx
  // ✅
  render(<MyComponent />);
  ```

### e2e testing

- Follow the e2e testing [best practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-best-practices) outlined in the Playwright docs.
- Structure large test suites using page object models:

  - Create separate classes for each major page/component
  - Encapsulate selectors and common actions

    ```ts filename="e2e/pages/conditions-page.ts"
    import { type Page } from "@playwright/test";

    export class ConditionsPage {
      constructor(readonly page: Page) {}

      readonly conditionsTable = () =>
        this.page.getByRole("table", { name: /conditions summary/i });

      async goTo(uuid: string) {
        await this.page.goto(`/openmrs/spa/patient/${uuid}/chart/Conditions`);
      }
    }
    ```

- Follow Playwright's [e2e testing best practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-best-practices):
  - Use web-first assertions instead of manual waits
  - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Use test fixtures for common setup/teardown

    ```ts
    test.beforeEach(async ({ api }) => {
      patient = await generateRandomPatient(api);
    });

    test("Record, edit and delete a condition", async ({ page }) => {
      const conditionsPage = new ConditionsPage(page);
      const headerRow = conditionsPage.conditionsTable().locator("thead > tr");
      const dataRow = conditionsPage.conditionsTable().locator("tbody > tr");

      await test.step("When I go to the Conditions page", async () => {
        await conditionsPage.goTo(patient.uuid);
      });

      await test.step("And I click on the `Record conditions` button", async () => {
        await conditionsPage.page.getByText(/record conditions/i).click();
      });

      await test.step("Then I should see the conditions form launch in the workspace", async () => {
        await expect(
          conditionsPage.page.getByText(/record a condition/i)
        ).toBeVisible();
      });
    });
    ```
