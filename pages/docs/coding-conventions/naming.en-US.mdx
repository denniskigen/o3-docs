# Naming

- Follow the guidelines in this [naming cheatsheet](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet).
- Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, methods, and class names.
- Use `kebab-case` for file names and folder names.
- Components should contain the `.component` suffix in their name (e.g. `user.component.tsx`). This nomenclature is used to distinguish components from other files such as resources, stylesheets, and tests, and determines where the i18next-parser tool extracts translation keys and strings from. Translation keys and strings will not be extracted from files that do not match this convention by default.
- Components may also contain different suffixes to indicate their purpose. These custom suffixes should be used in addition to the base `.component` suffix. They include:
  - `.extension` for components that render extensions e.g. [lab-order-basket-panel.extension.tsx](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/blob/main/packages/esm-patient-labs-app/src/lab-orders/lab-order-basket-panel/lab-order-basket-panel.extension.tsx#L21) for the `Lab Order Basket panel` extension.
  - `.modal` for components that render modals e.g. [delete-condition.modal.tsx](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/blob/main/packages/esm-patient-conditions-app/src/conditions/delete-condition.modal.tsx) for the `Delete Conditions` modal.
  - `.workspace` for components that render forms in the workspace e.g. [order-basket.workspace.tsx](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/blob/main/packages/esm-patient-orders-app/src/order-basket/order-basket.workspace.tsx#L4) for the `Order Basket` workspace.
- Unit and integration test files should contain the `.test` suffix in their name (e.g. `user.test.tsx`). Do not include the word `component` in the test file name.
- Playwright e2e tests should contain the `.spec` suffix in their name (e.g. `user.spec.ts`).
- Stylesheets should not contain `.component` suffix in their name. This is because stylesheets are not components, and are not translated by the translation system. Instead, stylesheets should be named after the component they are styling and use the `.module.scss` extension for CSS modules (e.g. `user.module.scss` for a component named `user.component.tsx`).
- Resource files that encapsulate data fetching logic should contain the `.resource` suffix in their name (e.g. `user.resource.ts`). This is to distinguish them from other files such as components, stylesheets, and tests.
- Use appropriate extensions for TypeScript files:
  - Use the `.tsx` extension for files that contain JSX.
  
  ```tsx
  // user.component.tsx
  const UserComponent: React.FC<UserComponentProps> => {
    return <div>User Component</div>
  }
  ```

  - Use the `.ts` extension for files that do not contain JSX.

  ```ts
  // user.resource.ts
  export const fetchUser = () => {
    return openmrsFetch<User>('/ws/rest/v1/user');
  }
  ```

  In most cases, you shouldn't need to use the `.tsx` extension for files outside the `src` directory.

- Follow the extension system [nomenclature guide](/docs/extension-system#nomenclature) when naming your extensions and extension slots.
- Use the file name as the component name. For example, `user.component.tsx` should contain a component named `UserComponent`. This makes it easier to find the component in the codebase.
- Avoid using DOM component prop names for different purposes. For example, avoid using the `style` prop to pass configuration options. Instead, use a descriptive prop name that matches its purpose, such as `config` or `options`.
- Use `camelCase` for prop names. This is consistent with the naming convention for variables, functions, and methods.
- Translation keys should be in `camelCase` whereas translation strings should be in `sentence case`. For example, `firstName` is a translation key whereas `First name` is its corresponding translation string.
- Frontend modules in monorepos should have names that start with the `esm-` prefix. The name of the module should describe what the module does. For example, `esm-user-management` is a good name for a frontend module handling user management concerns and `esm-patient-chart` is a good name for a frontend module handling patient chart concerns.
- Event handler props should be named after they event they handle `e.g. onClick` for a click handler. By convention, event handler props should start with the `on` prefix, followed by a capital letter.
- State updater functions should be named after the state they update. For example, `setFirstName` is a good name for a state updater function that updates the `firstName` state.
- What to name your branches is typically down to personal preference. However, when in doubt, name your branches using the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) type that your work conforms to, followed by a slash and a short dash-separated description of the work. Good examples include: `feat/debounced-order-basket-search`, `fix/missing-translation`, `chore/bump-dependencies` and `refactor/remove-unused-code`.
