# Releasing frontend modules

After you’ve met a reasonable threshold of commits, or after a set period of time, you’ll likely want to publish your software to the NPM registry so that consumers can get your latest stable versions.

To do this, you’ll want to leverage our release pipeline. Broadly speaking, when a PR gets merged, a `pre-release` job in our primary GitHub actions CI workflow gets triggered. This job publishes a version of the frontend module to its corresponding npm registry with the `latest` tag. To see what version the `latest` tag corresponds to for a frontend module, go to its NPM registry page and click on the `version` tag. Look out for the most recent version tagged `latest`.

The process of publishing a release in O3 has two parts:

1. Bumping your package versions locally and pushing those changes to GitHub. This step will trigger the `pre-release` job.
2.

If you want to publish an actual release version of your module, you need to think about a few things first, including:

- The release `type` - this is the semantic release type as determined by your changelog. Our release versions conform to the semver spec, meaning we can have three main release types:
  - `Patch` - when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  - `Minor` - when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
  - `Major` - when you make incompatible API changes.
    For example, if the most recently released version number for a frontend module is v1.0.0:
  - A `patch` version would increment the version number to `1.0.1`.
  - A `minor` version would increment the version number to `1.1.0`.
  - A `major` version would increment the version number to `2.0.0`.

Armed with that knowledge, you can proceed to draft a changelog. To do so:

- Go to the `releases` page of your frontend module’s monorepo, and click `Draft a new release`.
- Click the `Choose a tag` button in the releases page UI. Choose any tag, say `v1.0.1` if the most recent version is `v1.0.0`. We’ll likely change this shortly after reviewing the changelog. Set that value as the release title as well. Next, click the `Generate release notes` button. We’ve established a convention within O3 where PR titles contain a conventional commit `type` value that describes the kind of change the PR makes. These include:
  - `(feat)` for new features
  - `(fix)` for bug fixes
  - `(refactor)` for refactors
  - `(test)` for tests
  - `(docs)` for documentation
  - `(chore)` for housekeeping tasks, like managing dependencies, configuring things or updating CI workflows
  - `(BREAKING)`for backwards-incompatible API changes.

Reviewing the generated changelog with these commit types in mind should give you a good idea of the kind of semantic version bump your release ought to create. At this point, you can switch to your IDE to initiate the release process. Typically, we use lerna to version frontend modules. Run the following command to trigger a version change:

```jsx
npx lerna version
```

It should fire a prompt asking you to choose the type of version you want to release. You can determine this based on the changelog you drafted earlier. If your changelog mostly contains bug fixes that are backwards compatible, you likely want to do a patch release. If your changelog contains features and bug fixes that are backwards compatible, you likely want to do a minor release. Otherwise, if your changelog contains a breaking, backwards-incompatible change, you should do a major release.

Selecting a version type should effect a version bump and also update your `package.json` and `yarn.lock`. Once satisfied, commit these changes with the title `(chore) Release vx.x.x` where x.x.x is a placeholder for the version number. Once this commit gets merged on GitHub, the CI workflow's `pre-release` job gets triggered and initiates a version bump for the corresponding version tagged `latest` on NPM.

At this point, you can switch to your browser and head back to the releases page of the repo you’re working with. Review the release notes generated by GitHub, and then update the version number and tags appropriately. Once you’re satisfied that everything looks ok, click the `Publish release` button. This should trigger the CI workflow, and notably, the `release` job. Under the hood, that job runs the following script:

```jsx
"ci:publish-next": "lerna publish from-package --no-git-reset --dist-tag next --yes",
```

This command publishes a new package tagged `next`.

Once you’ve amended the release versions and the tag name appropriately, you can switch over to your code editor to bump versions of your frontend modules.
