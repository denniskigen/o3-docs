# Releasing frontend modules

[Releasing](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) frontend modules is a critical part of the development process. After meeting a reasonable threshold of commits, or after a set amount of time, you will likely want to publish your software to the NPM registry so that consumers can install it. This guide will walk you through the process of releasing frontend modules in the O3 ecosystem.

<Callout type="info">
  O3 currently follows a release cadence of two weeks. This means we aim to publish new versions of our frontend to our
  [QA environment](https://test3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa) every fortnight. QA review and feedback typically takes a
  week, after which we promote the release to our [demo Production environment](https://o3.openmrs.org/openmrs/spa).
  This cadence is subject to change as we get more experience with the process.

## Cutting a release

<Callout type="info">
  Please read through the [Important notes](#important-notes) section at the end of this page for guidance on some
  oft-overlooked steps in the release process.
</Callout>

Cutting an O3 release involves two steps:

1. Bumping your local package versions and pushing those changes to GitHub. This step will trigger the CI's `pre-release` job.
2. Cutting a release using the Github releases UI. This step triggers the `release` CI job, which publishes the package(s) to the NPM registry.

If you want to publish a release version of your module, you need to think about a few things first, including:

- The release `type` - the [semantic versioning release type](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) your changes conform to. Our release versions use the SemVer spec, meaning we have three release types:

  - `patch` - when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  - `minor` - when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
  - `major` - when you make incompatible API changes.

  For example, if the most recently released version number for a frontend module is `v1.0.0`:

  - A `patch` version would increment the version number to `1.0.1`.
  - A `minor` version would increment the version number to `1.1.0`.
  - A `major` version would increment the version number to `2.0.0`.

### Drafting a changelog

With that knowledge, you can draft a changelog. To do so:

- Go to the `releases` page of your monorepo, and click `Draft a new release`.
- Click the `Choose a tag` button in the releases page UI. Choose any tag, say `v1.0.1` for a `patch` release if the most recent version is `v1.0.0`. We will likely change this shortly after reviewing the changelog. Set that value as the release title as well. Next, click the `Generate release notes` button.

We have established a convention within O3 where PR titles contain a conventional commit `type` value that describes the kind of change the PR makes. These include:

- `(feat)` for new features
- `(fix)` for bug fixes
- `(refactor)` for refactors
- `(test)` for tests
- `(docs)` for documentation
- `(chore)` for housekeeping tasks, like managing dependencies, configuring things or updating CI workflows
- `(BREAKING)` for backwards-incompatible API changes.

Reviewing the generated changelog with these commit types in mind should give you a good idea of the semantic version bump your release should create.

### Bumping versions

At this point, you can switch to your IDE to initiate the release process. Typically, we use `yarn` to version frontend modules.

#### Monorepos

For monorepos, we use the `workspaces` command to bump versions across all packages in the monorepo. You'll typically find a `release` script in the root-level `package.json` file of the monorepo that looks like this:

```json
"release": "yarn workspaces foreach --all --topological version"
```

This script runs the `version` command against all the packages in the workspace. You'll need to append the release type to this command to trigger a version bump. So, for a `major` release, you would run:

```sh
yarn release major
```

This command:

- Runs the `version` command against all the packages in the workspace and bumps them to a major version. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, it would get bumped to `2.0.0`.first-letter.
- Tells yarn to sort the packages before running the commands so that they run on the packages in topological order (i.e., packages that depend on other packages get run later).
- Tells yarn to exclude versioning for the selected monorepo so that the package.json in the root directory is unaffected. The root `package.json` does not require a version for publishing purposes because it is never published.

#### Non-monorepos

For non-monorepos, you can use the `version` command directly. For example, if you want to bump the version of a package named `@openmrs/esm-patient-management` to a `major` release, you would run:

```sh
yarn version major --workspaces --scope @openmrs/esm-patient-management
```

**Libraries using legacy versions of yarn**

Some of our projects use legacy versions of yarn (yarn v1). The [Angular form engine](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-ngx-formentry) is an example of such a project. To release the Angular form engine, you would run the following command:

```sh
yarn version --new-version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version
```

Be sure to follow the instructions listed in the [Cutting a release docs](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-ngx-formentry#cutting-a-new-release) to avoid getting caught out.

### Post-bump steps

Once you're done versioning, you should see a diff in your editor that includes a version bump for all the packages in your repository. Run `yarn` or `yarn install` to update your `yarn.lock` file.

Create a new branch named `chore/release-vX.X.X` where `X.X.X` is the version number you are releasing. Commit these changes with the title `(chore) Release vX.X.X`. See an example of [this commit](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/pull/1279) that bumps `Patient Chart` to `v5.0.0`.

Once your release commit is merged, the CI workflow's `pre-release` job gets triggered and initiates a version bump for the corresponding version tagged `latest` on NPM. This version is what consumers get when they install your frontend module.

### Releasing on GitHub

You can then switch to your browser and head back to the releases page of the repo you are working with. Review the release notes generated by GitHub and then update the version number and tags appropriately.

<Callout type="info">
  Release notes should match the format of the [O3 changelog](/docs/changelog). This format includes a title, a
  description, and a list of changes. The main categories of changes are `Features`, `Bug Fixes`, `Breaking Changes`,
  `Refactors`, `Docs` and `Tests`. Each category should have a list of changes under it. You might need to do a bit more
  work to get the changelog to match this format. It's worth the effort, as it makes it easier for the Release Manager
  to review the changes and prepare release notes for the community.
</Callout>

Once you are satisfied that everything looks ok, click the `Publish release` button. This step should trigger the CI workflow and, notably, the `release` job.

Under the hood, that job runs the following script:

```json
"ci:prepublish": "yarn workspaces foreach --all --topological npm publish --access public --tag next",
```

This command publishes a new package tagged `next`. This is the version that consumers will get when they install your frontend module with the `next` tag. This is useful for testing new features before they get released to the `latest` tag.

Broadly speaking, when a PR is merged, a `pre-release` job in our primary GitHub actions CI workflow gets triggered. This job publishes a version of the frontend module to its corresponding npm registry tagged `latest`. This is the version that consumers will get when they install your frontend module.

To see what version the `latest` tag corresponds to for a frontend module, go to its NPM registry page and click on the `version` tag. Look out for the most recent version tagged `latest`.

### Important notes

- When versioning the [Angular form engine](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-ngx-formentry), ensure you bump both the version in the root-level `package.json` file and the version in the `package.json` file in the `projects/openmrs-esm-formentry` directory. The actual library is published from that directory, so it's important to bump the version there as well. More information can be found in [this section](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-ngx-formentry#cutting-a-new-release) of the README.
- When versioning the [Patient Chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart), ensure you bump the Common Lib peer dependency in each of the packages that depend on it. Here's an example of a release commit that bumps both the package version and the peer dependency version: [chore: Release v7.0.0](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart/pull/1639/files).
