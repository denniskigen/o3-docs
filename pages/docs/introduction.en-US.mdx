# Introduction

O3 is a modular, extensible frontend framework for OpenMRS. It provides shared components, APIs, and templates so teams
can build user interfaces faster.

## Guiding principles

O3 is guided by the following principles:

- **Reuse over rework** - shared components, APIs, and templates reduce duplicated effort.
- **Modular by design** - add, remove, or update modules without rebuilding the system.
- **Configuration-first** - each frontend module declares its config properties.
- **Usability first** - optimized for point-of-care workflows and complex clinical records.
- **Modern stack** - approachable for a global developer community.
- **Interoperable** - built to work with FHIR and other standards.

## What O3 is _not_

O3 is **not** a new platform version of OpenMRS. It runs on top of your existing database and uses the same REST and
FHIR APIs as the O2 UI. While O3 requires minimum versions of the platform and some backend modules, you do not need to
overhaul your backend to use it. To run O3 on an existing installation, follow this
[recipe](/docs/recipes/set-up-o3-instance).

## Technology stack

### Frontend

- [React](https://react.dev) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to JavaScript, which allows for static type checking and better tooling support.
- [Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com) - an open-source design system from IBM.
- [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org) - JavaScript router for frontend microservices.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - module bundler for JavaScript applications.

### Backend APIs

- [OpenMRS REST](https://rest.openmrs.org)
- [FHIR](https://om.rs/fhir)
