# Prerequisite knowledge

Before developing on O3, you should be familiar with the following technologies:

## JavaScript

Knowing JavaScript is prerequisite to everything else. We recommend going through the following resources:

- [Introduction to JavaScript - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [JavaScript to know for React - Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
- [JavaScript for impatient programmers](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/toc.html)
- [Josh Comeau's Operator lookup](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/)

## React

The [official docs](https://react.dev/) are a great way to get acquainted with React. **Don't gloss over [the fundamentals](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)**. Having a solid understanding of its core concepts is imperative in enabling you to learn how to develop high-quality frontend modules in O3. We also recommend going through the following resources:

- [Writing resilient components - Dan Abramov (dated but still very useful)](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/)
- [A (Mostly) Complete Guide to React Rendering Behavior - Mark Erikson](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/05/blogged-answers-a-mostly-complete-guide-to-react-rendering-behavior/)
- [Why React Re-renders - Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/why-react-re-renders/)
- [Beginners Guide to React - Kent C. Dodds (dated but still very useful)](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)

## TypeScript

Most of our code is written in TypeScript. We recommend going through the following resources:

- [TypeScript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials)
- [React + TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)

## JavaScript tooling

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - we use yarn as our package manager. Generally, if the repository you're looking at has a `yarn.lock` file at its root, then it uses yarn.
- [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) - we use `lerna` to manage our monorepos.
- [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo) - we use `turbo` to run scripts during both local development and in our continuous integration processes.
- [swc](https://swc.rs/) - we use SWC to compile our JavaScript and TypeScript code into a format supported by all major browsers.
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - we use webpack to bundle our code for production. We use [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/), which is the latest version of webpack at the time of writing.

## Git

It is imperative that you keep your code in a version control system. OpenMRS uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/). You should know the basics of using Git and GitHub. Great learning resources include:

- Learn [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- [Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
- [Dangit, Git](https://dangitgit.com/en)

## OpenMRS

- [OpenMRS data model](http://devmanual.openmrs.org/en/Technology/dataModel.html)
- [REST API](https://rest.openmrs.org/)
- [FHIR wiki](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/FHIR+101%3A+OpenMRS+Strategy%2C+Tools%2C+FHIR+API%2C+and+Help)
