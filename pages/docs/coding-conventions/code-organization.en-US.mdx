# Code organization

- Colocate related files in the same directory. Each component should have its own directory containing all its associated files. This includes:
  - Component file (e.g., `patient-banner.component.tsx`) - This is a React component.
  - Test file (e.g., `patient-banner.test.tsx`) - This is a Jest test file.
  - Stylesheet (e.g., `patient-banner.scss`) - This is a CSS stylesheet.
  - Resource file (e.g., `patient-banner.resource.ts`) - This is a file that contains data fetching logic.
  - Any other related files (e.g., constants, types, utilities)

  Example directory structure:

  ```
  src/
  └── patient-banner/
      ├── patient-banner.component.tsx
      ├── patient-banner.test.tsx
      ├── patient-banner.scss
      └── patient-banner.resource.ts
  ```

  This approach:
  - Makes it easier to find and modify related files
  - Simplifies refactoring and maintenance
  - Keeps the codebase modular and well-organized
  - Makes it clear which files belong to which component

- Avoid placing styles for multiple components in the same stylesheet. Instead, create a separate stylesheet for each component. This makes it easier to find the styles for a particular component.
- Use the [template app](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app) to quickly seed new O3 frontend modules:
  1. Visit the [template repository](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app)
  2. Click the green `Use this template` button
  3. Choose `Create a new repository`
  4. Follow the setup instructions in the template's README

  The template provides:
  - Correct TypeScript configuration
  - Pre-configured testing setup with Jest
  - ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Basic project structure following O3 conventions
  - Example components and tests

- Group imports alphabetically based on their type. The recommended order is:
  - React and framework imports (e.g., `React`, `useState`, `useEffect`)
  - External modules (e.g., `lodash`, `dayjs`, `react-i8next`)
  - Carbon component imports (e.g., `Button`, `InlineLoading`)
  - OpenMRS imports (e.g., `@openmrs/esm-framework`, `@openmrs/esm-patient-common-lib`)
  - Local imports (components, hooks, utilities, etc.)
  - Asset imports (e.g `import styles from './user.scss'`)

  In the near future, we'll be able to use ESLint import order sorting to enforce this convention. Following this convention makes it easier to maintain consistency across the codebase.

- Consolidate library imports into a single import statement. This makes it easier to see which modules are being used and makes the code more readable. For example, prefer:

  ```tsx
  // Good
  import { Button, InlineLoading } from '@carbon/react';
  ```

  Over:

  ```tsx
  // Bad
  import { Button } from '@carbon/react';
  import { InlineLoading } from '@carbon/react';
  ```

  Note that you should still keep imports from different modules separate:

  ```tsx
  // Good - separate imports for different modules
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
  import { Button, DataTable } from '@carbon/react';
  import { useConfig, showSnackbar } from '@openmrs/esm-framework';
  ```

  Type imports should be marked with the `type` keyword. An ESLint plugin will automatically flag any type imports that are not marked with the `type` keyword.

  ```tsx
  // Good
  import { showModal, type Visit } from '@openmrs/esm-framework';
  ```

- Place type annotations and interfaces at the top of the file, after the imports and above any component code. Since TypeScript types and interfaces are development-time constructs that get removed during compilation, they don't affect the runtime behavior of your code.

   ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
  import { Button } from '@carbon/react';
  import { showSnackbar } from '@openmrs/esm-framework';

  // Type definitions come after imports, before component code
  interface UserData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    role: 'admin' | 'user';
  }

  type UserComponentProps = {
    userData: UserData;
    onSave: (data: UserData) => void;
    isEditable?: boolean;
  };

  // Component code follows type definitions
  export const UserComponent: React.FC<UserComponentProps> = ({ 
    userData,
    onSave,
    isEditable = false 
  }) => {
    // ... component implementation
  };
  ```

  Some key points about type placement:
  - Keep related types and interfaces grouped together
  - Place more generic types before more specific ones that might depend on them
  - Consider extracting commonly used types into a separate `types.ts` file if they're used across multiple components

  On whether to use `type` aliases or `interface` declarations:
  - Use `interface` when you need declaration merging or inheritance.
  - Use `type` for unions, intersections, primitives, tuples, and utility types.
  - Be consistent within your codebase - if your team has standardized on one approach, follow that convention.

  ```ts
  // Use interface for object shapes
  interface UserProps {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    onSave: (data: User) => void;
  }
  ```

  ```ts
  // Use type for unions and more complex types
  type Status = 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
  type ButtonKind = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  type Nullable<T> = T | null;
  ```
